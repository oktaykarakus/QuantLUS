****************************************** QuantLUS - CPS v1.0 **************************************************

This source code package includes the MATLAB source codes for implementing a novel method for line artefacts quantification in lung ultrasound (LUS) images of COVID-19 patients. The method is formulated as a non-convex regularisation problem involving a sparsity-enforcing, Cauchy-based penalty function, and the inverse Radon transform. Moreover, a simple local maxima detection technique in the Radon transform domain, associated with known clinical definitions of line artefacts, is employed. The method accurately identifies both horizontal and vertical line artefacts in LUS images. In order to reduce the number of false and missed detection, the method includes a two-stage validation mechanism, which is performed in both Radon and image domains.

This package includes two folders:

	1) images		: Stores images for line artefacts quantification study. We have only shared an 
				example test image with name: testImage1.mat.
	
	2) source functions	: Stores five source functions:
		2.1) radonT.m
		2.2) BLinesStats.m
		2.3) CauchyProx.m
		2.4) CPS_Bline.m
	        2.5) Detect_Bline.m

and the main MATLAB script:

	1) QuantLUS_CPS.m
